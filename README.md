**Status:**
30 July 2020

Deployed but still under deployment. I meant to have this finished 6 months agao but start new work and everything dropp off the priority list.  
However, a recent PR has prompted me to chip away at it again on the weekends.

Next stage of development will "modernise" the code to ES6, introduce Vue single file components and use Parcel.js for compilation. 
I started this with pure in-browser scripts to cut down on screwing around with build tools but it's now large enough to need them for better code architecture.
